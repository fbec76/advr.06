\title{Greedy Heuristic Knapsack Function
Solves the knapsack problem using a greedy heuristic approach.
This algorithm sorts items by their value-to-weight ratio in descending order
and greedily selects items until the knapsack capacity is reached.
Note: This is a heuristic method that may not always find the optimal solution.}
\usage{
greedy_knapsack(x, W, fast = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data.frame with two numeric columns: \code{v} for item values and \code{w} for item weights.}

\item{W}{A positive numeric value representing the maximum capacity of the knapsack.}

\item{fast}{A logical value. If TRUE, uses the C++ implementation for better performance. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{value}{The total value of the selected items (may not be optimal).}
\item{elements}{An integer vector of indices corresponding to the selected items.}
}
